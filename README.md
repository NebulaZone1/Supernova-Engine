# Everlast Engine
A Friday Night Funkin' engine that will try to improve your modding experience. For now, this readme is a wip until the engines release.

# Building
To get started, you need the following programs:
- Haxe 4.2.5
- VS Community 2019/VS Code

Now we need to install some libraries, open up the 'Libraries Updater' bat file to make it install the required files.
